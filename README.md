Implement two functions named <strong>quick_sort</strong> and <strong>insertion_sort</strong>.<strong>  </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Request the user to enter a positive integer, and call it <strong>n</strong>. (n = 1000)</li>

 <li>Generate <strong>n</strong> random integers between <strong>-5000 to 5000</strong> and save them in array <strong>a</strong>.</li>

 <li>Call <strong>quick_sort</strong> and <strong>insertion_sort</strong> functions to sort the array.</li>

 <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for <strong>100</strong> times to determine the <strong>average-running time</strong> of each function.</li>

 <li>Print the end/finish time for your function. (<strong><u>Note</u></strong><strong>:</strong> to be more precise, the time to generate a random array in each iteration should be excluded from the result)</li>

 <li>Calculate the growth of each function. (On a scratch paper!)</li>

 <li><strong>Write a code</strong> to calculate how many instructions your machine/laptop can run in <strong>a second</strong> using step 5 and 6 using the <em>insertion</em></li>
